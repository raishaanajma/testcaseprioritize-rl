The dataset is in .csv format, there are 1314 rows and 8 columns in this data set, It has been collected from the MIS of a local industry's documents. 
The detail of six attributes are as under:
B_Req --> Business Requirement
R_Prioirty -->  Requirement Priority of particular business requirement(It can be any prioritization method but in or converted to numerical form it has been extrRacted from requirement tracibility matrix)
Weight--> I have assigned a weitage against "R_Priority(Requirement Priorirty)" its ceiteria is as under:
In Project they have used MSCoW Requiremet Prioirty Technique to assign priority:
>I have assigned 1 to the "Must have" requirement
>I assigned 2 to the "Should have" requirement
> I assigned 3 to both "Could have" and "Would Have" requirement[1]
FP --> Function point of each testing task, which in our case are test cases against each requirement under covers a particular FP
Complexity --> Complexity of a particular function point or related modules(the description of assigning complexity is listed below in this section)*
Complexity of function points in a system determines, the greater number of functionalities a system has, the more complex the system is. 
There are three types of it: 
Complex, Medium and Simple
•	Complex functionality is one that consist of multiple interacting components, having weightage 5.
•	Medium functionality is with limited number of components, having weightage 3.
•	Simple is the one, which is composed of small number of components, having weightage 1

Time --> Estimated max time assigned to each Function Point of particular testing task by QA team lead or sr. SQA analyst
Cost --> Calculated cost for each function point using complexity and time with function point estimation technique to calculate cost using the formula listed below:
cost = Cost = (Complexity * Time) * average amount set per task or per Function Point
note: In this case it is set as 7$ per man hour for each FP.
Prioirty --> Is the assigned testcases priority against each Function Point by the testing team, QA Team lead or SQA analyst.
